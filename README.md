# Basic-Planner
This project is a lightweight web-based task scheduling application developed to help users organize their daily activities efficiently. It allows users to add tasks along with their scheduled time, track completion status, and manage their routine in a structured way through an interactive interface.

The application is built using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, focusing on simplicity, usability, and visual clarity.

Through this project, I explored core front-end development concepts such as DOM manipulation, event handling, and dynamic content updates to create a practical and user-oriented productivity tool.
